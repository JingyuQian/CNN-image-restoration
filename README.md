# Deep-learning---CNN-RNN
Theano Neural network implementation: convolutional neural network and recursive neural network. 


1. Basic CNN structure for CIFAR-10 dataset classification problem. 

2. Additional noise injection, translation, rotation and flipping as data augmentation approaches to improve the test accuracy.

3. CNN structure for corrupted image restoration.
